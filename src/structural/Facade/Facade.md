Facade pattern is used when we are using multiple classes and don't want the client side to deal with all of it, and instead provide it with an abstraction that handles all these classes for it.

```java

// Client Code
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Booking a movie ticket manually (without a facade)
        // Handling everything from client creates unnecessary complexities for client
        // Step 1: Make payment
        PaymentService paymentService = new PaymentService();
        paymentService.makePayment("user123", 500);

        // Step 2: Reserve seat
        SeatReservationService seatReservationService = new SeatReservationService();
        seatReservationService.reserveSeat("movie456", "A10");

        // Step 3: Send booking confirmation via email
        NotificationService notificationService = new NotificationService();
        notificationService.sendBookingConfirmation("user@example.com");

        // Step 4: Add loyalty points to user's account
        LoyaltyPointsService loyaltyPointsService = new LoyaltyPointsService();
        loyaltyPointsService.addPoints("user123", 50);

        // Step 5: Generate the ticket
        TicketService ticketService = new TicketService();
        ticketService.generateTicket("movie456", "A10");
    }
}
